### Hi there 👋
I'm a high school student just messing around with stuff for now.
- 🔭 I’m not currently working on anything.
- 📚 I have experience with Linux (most distros), programming (C++ & C, HTML & CSS, shell, and more, although I grasp programming concepts very well), and computer hardware.
- 🧠 I'm interested in the above, as well as pixel art, cybersecurity, networking, video games, and math/numbers/data.
- 🙏 I’m able to collaborate on just about anything I find interesting, email me.
- ❤ I love anything hacky and doing fun stuff with 10+-year-old laptops.
- 📫 You can reach me at tpenland08@gmail.com.
- (I'm rather busy, so I may not be able to get much of anything extra done.)
